<p><h3 style="color:#9400D3">Hello...I am Soumyadeep Debnath, 28 year old Software developer/learner. I have been part of the Software development

Development process involving Spring & Hibernate Framework. I am currently learning HTML & CSS as they constitute the fundamnetals of Web development. In  the short to medium term I am

<p><h3 style="color:#DC143C">Last season, Sunrisers Hyderabad were easily the most criticised outfit in the Indian Premier League. No one really saw the 'ostracisation' of 
David Warner coming and their own fan base had a go at them constantly towards the end of the campaign. 
The SRH-Warner split was pretty much evident at that stage as the franchise opted to not retain him ahead of the mega 
auction. But what came as a surprise later on was their failure to keep hold of Rashid Khan as well.
The Afghanistan legspinner is easily one of the most sought-after players in the world in T20 cricket 
and the franchise's inability to retain him meant they had to enter a new era without their two lynchpins around
whom their success in recent years was built.</h3></p>
<br>
<p><h3 style="color:#8B008B">On expected lines, the franchise handed over the reins to Kane Williamson on a full-time basis. 
Leading SRH isn't unfamiliar territory for Williamson. He did lead them to the final in 2018 when Warner was unavailable
and in the Australian's absence, the New Zealander went on to score more than 700 runs in the season as well.
SRH will be glad that they have one of the world's most likeable cricketers leading them after 
a chaotic season but can he replicate the success they have had over the years?
